# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Module 6 of DU's Data Analytics bootcamp introduced using API's and parsing JSONs to collect and analyze data. The ability to utilize this kind of data gathering technique opens up the world of data to our programming and analysis toolbox. I will explore the data collected below and provide analysis and visualization to bring the story to life and hopefully provide some meaning to users of this information. The underlying code is written in Python and utilizes Pandas and NumPy libraries, an online weather API, and the CityPy module.
